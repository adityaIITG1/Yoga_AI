**Yoga AI (Web)** is a cutting-edge web application that combines ancient yogic wisdom with modern Computer Vision and Bio-Analytics. Built with **Next.js** and **MediaPipe**, it turns your webcam into a smart yoga instructor that tracks your mudras, monitors your energy alignment, and guides you into deep meditation states.

## 🌟 Key Features

### 👁️ Advanced Computer Vision
- **Real-time Mudra Detection**: Instantly recognizes sacred hand gestures including **Gyan**, **Surya**, **Prana**, **Apana**, **Varun**, and **Namaste**.
- **Posture & Alignment**: Tracks body landmarks to ensure correct yoga forms.
- **Face & Eye Tracking**: Detects eye closure for **Meditation Mode** and tracks gaze for **Third Eye Focus** training.

### 📊 Bio-Analytics Engine
- **Heart & SpO2 Monitoring**: Integrates with hardware sensors (MAX30100/Arduino) to display real-time **Heart Rate (BPM)** and **Oxygen Levels**.
- **Stress & Focus Analysis**: visualizes **HRV Index**, **Stress Levels**, and **Focus Score** based on physiological data.
- **Nadi Pariksha**: Digital estimation of your **Vata**, **Pitta**, and **Kapha** dosha balance.

### 🤖 Smart AI Coach
- **Interactive Voice Assistant**: Provides real-time audio feedback in a calming Indian female voice.
- **Intelligent Guidance**: Suggests mudras to balance specific weak chakras based on your energy readings.
- **Energy Coherence Radar**: Visualizes the harmony between your mind and body.

### 🌈 Spiritual Gamification
- **XP & Leveling System**: Earn XP for holding mudras and maintaining focus. Level up your spiritual journey!
- **Chakra Visualization**: Beautiful, dynamic overlays showing the activation and balancing of your 7 Chakras.
- **Meditation Rewards**: Unlock "Deep Meditation" states and earn energy bonuses.

### 🔌 Hardware Integration (Bio-Feedback)
We use a **MAX30100 / Pulse Sensor** to bring real physiological data into the AI experience.

**How it Works (PPG Principle):**
1.  **Photoplethysmography:** The sensor detects changes in blood flow volume in the microvascular bed of tissue.
2.  **Light Intensity:** As your heart beats, blood flow changes, altering the intensity of reflected light.
3.  **Signal Conversion:** This optical variation is converted into an electrical signal.
4.  **Real-time Analysis:** The system calculates your **Heart Rate (BPM)** and **SpO2** instantly.

**Why we use it:**
- ❤️ **Real-time Biofeedback:** Directly links your physical state to the digital Yoga experience.
- 🧘 **Meditation Validation:** Verifies calmness through lowered heart rate variability.

**Common Applications:**
- ❤️ Heartbeat / Pulse detection
- 🧘 Yoga & Meditation biofeedback systems
- 🤖 Arduino / ESP32 health monitoring projects
- 📊 Stress and Fitness tracking demos
